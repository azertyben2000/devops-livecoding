# DevOps Livecoding Project

## Introduction

This DevOps Livecoding Project is a comprehensive example designed to illustrate the practical application of DevOps tools and practices. It integrates various technologies to demonstrate continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and infrastructure as code (IaC) through a sample application.

## Project Architecture

The project consists of the following main components:

- **Backend Service**: A RESTful API serving as the core business logic layer, implemented in [Node.js/Java/Python (choose appropriate technology)].
- **Frontend Interface**: A web-based user interface built with [React/Angular/Vue.js] to interact with the backend service.
- **Database**: [MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB] database for data persistence.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated workflows configured with GitHub Actions for testing, building, and deploying the application components.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Ansible playbooks for provisioning and managing infrastructure configurations.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: [Node.js/Java/Python]
- Frontend: [React/Angular/Vue.js]
- Database: [MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB]
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure: Ansible, Docker
- Others: [Any other significant technologies used]

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding with the setup:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Ansible (for infrastructure automation)
- Git (for version control)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/azertyben2000/devops-livecoding.git
cd devops-livecoding


2. **Backend Setup:**

Navigate to the backend directory and follow the README instructions to set up the backend service.

`cd backend`

3. **Frontend Setup:**

Similarly, set up the frontend by navigating to its directory and following the setup instructions.

`cd ../frontend`


4. **Database Setup:**

Instructions for setting up the database can be found in the database configuration directory.

`docker-compose up --build`


### Using Ansible for Infrastructure Automation

1. **Ansible Playbooks:**

The `ansible` directory contains playbooks for provisioning and configuring the necessary infrastructure for the project.

`cd ansible`


2. **Environment Variables:**

Ensure to set up the required environment variables or Ansible variables for configuration management.
